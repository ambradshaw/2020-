# 2020-
I'm gonna level with you here: Let's be realistic, if you're reading this, you're probably screwed for this class. Sri's likely on his
bullshit again which, while entertaining, isn't exactly helpful when you've got 5 culmulative assignments due all at once (we both know
 you haven't done shit) and you haven't slept in a few days. 
 
 I wrote most of this code in a state of some combination of intoxication and sleep deprivation, and it probably shows. I did document 
 enough for Sri to mark it though, so you should be able to sort out what exactly I did, because god knows I don't remember. That being
 said I'm pretty damn proud of everything here given the circumstances I had to write it under, because as bad as you might think
 this class is now, it's about 10 times worse during the summer as a co-op student.
 
 Chug a rockstar, grab your vice of choice and settle in, you're in for a time.
 
 May the force be with you (you're fucked m8).
